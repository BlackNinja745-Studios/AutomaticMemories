# Automatic Memories

Automatic Memories periodically takes screenshots, capturing memories of your Minecraft experience.
This mod takes screenshots at set intervals, so when you return, you'll find hundreds of unexpected snapshots capturing your time in the game.

## Inspiration

There's a few YouTube videos that compile years' worth of accidentally taken screenhots, offering an unexpected glimpse into the players' long-term experience in Minecraft.
Unfortunately, if you rarely mispress keys or have a keyboard without dedicated function keys, you might miss out on this unique perspective of your playtime.
This mod solves this by automatically taking a screenshot every 3 hours by default, over time giving you a catalog of random screenshots!

## Configuration

AutomaticMemories is a simple and lightweight mod, but it still offers plenty of configuration options, allowing you to tailor it to your exact preferences.
[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) and [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) are required to configure the mod.

Using the configuration you can make the screenshots more or less frequent, save them in a different folder, or skip taking a screenshot when you aren't in game.
By default, this mod will carry over the timer between sessions. For exmaple, if you set the interval to every four hours and play for three hours one day, the next time you play it will take a screenshot one hour in.
This is useful since you probably won't often play for as long as your interval is, which would mean the mod wouldn't ever take a screenshot. Leaving "Restart timer each session" disabled solves this.
